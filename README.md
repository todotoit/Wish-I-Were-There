# Wish I Were There
_Wish I Were There stems from the awareness that self-isolating is the right thing to do during the pandemic, but it also makes our favorite places feel like a constellation of faraway stars. It allows us to create a collective sky map of daydreams, of all the places where our heart goes while we need to stay at home. Sharing these new stars will bring us closer, even while we need to stay apart._

Wish I Were There is a website based on [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue), which leverages Google Maps APIs to create a collective map of daydreams during the quarantine period due to the covid-19 epidemic.
