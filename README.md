# Wish I Were There
_Self-isolating is the right thing to do during the pandemic. But it also makes our favorite places feel like a constellation of faraway stars, and we wish we could just think about the future and already be there. Stay safe and we will get there._

Wish I Were There is a web application based on [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue), leveraging Google Maps SDK to create a collective map of daydreams during this quarantine period.
